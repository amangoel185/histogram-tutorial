## Abstract

Recent developments in Scikit-HEP libraries have enabled fast, efﬁcient histogramming powered by boost-histogram. Hist provides useful shortcuts for plotting and proﬁles based on boost-histogram. This talk aims to discuss these histogramming packages built on the histogram-as-an-object concept.

The attendees would learn how to use these tools to easily make histograms, perform various operations on them, and make their analysis more efficient and easy. The talk would also discuss some examples and use cases, recent developments and future plans for these packages.
